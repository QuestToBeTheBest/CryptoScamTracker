# CryptoScam
This program was created as part of my capstone research project at IUPUI. The program is an attempt to track transaction history of ethereum wallet adresses that are thought to be associated with hacking or scams. As a criminal attempts to get away with the stollen crypto, they scramble the money to differnt wallet addresses in order to hide themselves. But this program tries to determine those new addresses.
