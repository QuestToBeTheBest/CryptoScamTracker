# CryptoScam
This program was created as part of my capstone research project at IUPUI. The program is an attempt to track transaction history of ethereum wallet adresses that are thought to be associated with fraud or scams. As a criminal attempts to get away with their stollen crypto, they usually try to scramble the money to differnt wallet addresses to try and mask themselves. But this program attempts to determine those new addresses which they have moved to.
