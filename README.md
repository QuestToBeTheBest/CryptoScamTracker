# CryptoScam
This program was created as part of my capstone research project at IUPUI. The program is an attempt to track transation history of ethereum wallet adresses that are known to be associated with fraud or scams. As the criminal attempts to get away with their stollen crypto, they scramble the assets to differnt wallet addresses to try to mask themselves. But this program attempts to determine where they are trying to scramble.
