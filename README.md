# CryptoScam
This program was created as part of my capstone research project at IUPUI. The program is an attempt to track transaction history of ethereum wallet adresses that are thought to be associated with hacking or scams. As a criminal attempts to get away with stollen cryptocurrency, they scramble money to differnt wallet addresses to hide themselves. But this program tries to determine those new addresses the money is scrambled to.
